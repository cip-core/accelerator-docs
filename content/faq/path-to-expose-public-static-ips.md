## Question

Is there a straightforward path to exposing public static IPs for services?

## Answer

Static IPs of services running inside the cluster are trivial. Simply specify the `ClusterIP` field in the pod spec. However, externally available public IPs are a different story.  This is now possible with the new Network Load Balancers (NLBs) on AWS (announced last re:invent)  However, we haven't tried using them yet with Kubernetes.

Itâ€™s quite easy to implement though. Simply add the following annotation to the Service Load Balancer for the ingress to switch from the default mode of `elb` to `nlb`.

  ```
    annotations:
    # by default the type is elb (Classic Load Balancer).
    service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-type: nlb```

NLBs are highly performant and the superior option in the long run. See [here.](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-network-load-balancer-effortless-scaling-to-millions-of-requests-per-second/)
